### **Hello, I'm Paradis** ###

I am a software engineer currently studying a Batchler degree in Game Development.
Currently looking to join a team or start working. With more than 6 years of experience in general programming, i have a vast variety of ideas and projects, on this same github you can find 6 pinned; those are the ones that i like the most, nonetheless, there's a lot more in repositories.
